Warhammer 40,000 is a tabletop war game in which players command armies of Citadel miniatures and attempt to defeat their opponent through a mixture of skill, tactics and luck. Storytelling is at the core of Warhammer 40,000, with the rules designed to bring to life the epic conflicts between the forces of Mankind, aliens and daemons in the grim darkness of the far future. The purpose of the game is for all players to have an enjoyable shared experience, putting their tactical skills to the test while admiring the spectacle of amazing miniatures clashing on fantastic battlefields. In this spirit, good sportsmanship and politeness are at the heart of the game.\n",

If no single solution presents itself, you and your opponent should roll off, and whoever rolls highest gets to choose what happens. Then you can get on with the fighting!\n",

It is good practice to always make sure your opponent knows what you are rolling dice for, and what abilities and rules are in effect that enable you to make any re-rolls. Many gamers roll their dice somewhere on the battlefield, but some roll their dice elsewhere, such as in a dice tray. Wherever you roll your dice, make sure you roll the dice where your opponent can see the results too. If a dice is rolled out of bounds (i.e. it rolls off your battlefield, out of your dice tray or ends up on the floor), it is very common to ignore the result of that dice and roll it again. Rolling an out-of-bounds dice again doesn't count as having re-rolled that dice. If a dice does not lie flat on your battlefield after it has been thrown, it is called a cocked dice. Some players use a house rule that unless a dice is flat after it has been rolled, or unless you can balance another dice on top of a cocked dice without it sliding off, it must be rolled again. It is more common for players to roll the dice again only if they can't be sure of the result. In any case, rolling a cocked dice again doesn't count as having re-rolled that dice.\n",

            "\n",
            "The rules for making attacks have been written assuming you will resolve them one at a time. However, it is possible to speed up your battles by rolling the dice for similar attacks together. In order to make several attacks at once, all of the attacks must have the same Ballistic Skill (if it's a ranged attack) or the same Weapon Skill (if it's a melee attack). They must also have the same Strength and Armour Penetration characteristics, they must inflict the same Damage, they must be affected by the same abilities, and they must be directed at the same unit. If this is the case, make all of the Hit rolls at the same time, then all of the Wound rolls. Your opponent can then allocate the attacks one at a time, making the saving throws and suffering damage each time as appropriate. Note that if all the models in the target unit would require the same saving throw against the attacks, and the order in which the attacks are allocated would make no difference, then your opponent can make all their saving throws at the same time, and can do so as soon as the Wound rolls have been made. If they do, they then allocate the attacks that resulted in failed saving throws one at a time, inflicting the damage as appropriate even though, strictly speaking, saving throws should be made after attacks have been allocated. In any case, remember that if the target unit contains a model that has already lost any wounds or has already had attacks allocated to it this phase, the controlling player must allocate further attacks to that model until either it is destroyed, or all the attacks have been saved or resolved. If the attacks being allocated to a target inflict random damage, you cannot use the fast dice rolling approach exactly as stated above - you will need to roll the dice one at a time. Consider several attacks with a Damage characteristic of D3 being allocated to a target containing models with two wounds each. As excess damage is lost each time a model is destroyed, the order in which the attacks are allocated and resolved becomes important. If the results of those D3s were 1, then 2, then 3, the attacks would result in a total of two destroyed models, but applying them in the order 3, then 2, then 1 would result in two models being destroyed and a third being damaged with only one wound remaining. As such, the rolls should be made one at a time.\n",

If a mission uses objective markers, it will state where they are located on the battlefield. These can be represented using any suitable marker, but we recommend using round markers that are 40mm in diameter. When setting objective markers up on the battlefield, place them so they are centred on the point specified by the mission. When measuring distances to and from objective markers, measure to and from the closest part of them. Models can move over objective markers as if they were not there, but they cannot end a move on top of an objective marker. At the start of the battle, each objective marker on the battlefield is said to be contested, and so is not controlled by either player. To control an objective marker, a player will first need to move models within range of it. A model is within range of an objective marker if it is within 3\" horizontally and 5\" vertically of that objective marker. Every model has an Objective Control (OC) characteristic listed on its datasheet. To determine a player's Level of Control over an objective marker, add together the OC characteristics of all the models from that player's army that are within range of that objective marker. A player will control an objective marker at the end of any phase if their Level of Control over it is greater than their opponent's. If both players have the same Level of Control over an objective marker, that objective marker is contested. \n",

When setting up terrain features, you can place them where an objective marker would be, so long as you can reposition that objective marker directly on top of that terrain feature and it lies flat, without overhanging any part of it. That objective marker should still be more than 1\" away from all impassable parts of that terrain feature (such as the walls of a ruin) so that there is sufficient room for models to move around it. If it is not possible to set up terrain features or objective markers in this way, and both players agree, you can nudge the positions of any terrain feature or objective marker so that these conditions are satisfied. Of course, the final position of an objective marker should still be as close as possible to the location indicated on your mission's deployment map, but if both players are happy to tweak the battlefield arrangement to forge a stronger narrative, you should feel free to do so.\n",
